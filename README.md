# cc8_cipher
cc8 block cipher implementation in c

## Problem definition

Modify the main() function of cc8.c code to automatically test the cipher with more than 1 million plaintext-key pairs.

You must compute the avalanche value for each pair and also compute an overall average avalanche value.

Clearly comment the code you insert/remove/modify so that evaluators can easily see and understand your work.

Keep the verbosity to a minimum.
